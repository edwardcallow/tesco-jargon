## K is for…

#### Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Targets set to help us evaluate our performance such as sales and waste. This is used across the business and is a way of proving you’re doing well. You may hear people refer to KPIs.

#### Keeping us legal (KUL)
Training material for managers that focuses on legal trading requirements, backed up by the safe and legal record.
> See also [safe and legal record](s.md#safe-and-legal-record).


#### Know your stuff (KYS)
Stores’ training solution produced by Tesco Academy. Our training is split into three different levels: bronze, silver and gold. Staff will work through the bronze and silver levels when they join Tesco. These go through all the different elements of the job. Gold level is optional if people wish to progress or learn a new skill. We also have manager’s workbooks for the different departments within the store. Largely replaced by click and learn.
