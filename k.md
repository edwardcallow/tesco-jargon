## K is for…

#### Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Targets set to help us evaluate our performance such as sales and waste. This is used across the business and is a way of proving you’re doing well. You may hear people refer to KPIs.

#### Know your stuff (KYS)
This is the name that we give to our stores’ training solution. Our training is split into three different levels: bronze, silver and gold. Staff will work through the bronze and silver levels when they join Tesco. These go through all the different elements of the job. Gold level is optional if people wish to progress or learn a new skill. We also have manager’s workbooks for the different departments within the store.
