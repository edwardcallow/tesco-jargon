This site is based on a store comminications book from July 2010 called ‘Talking Tesco: Jargonbuster’. We’ve updated a few entries and added many more. The following is taken from that book.

**Why a jargonbuster?**
- To make things easier for everyone to understand, we encourage people to use everyday language and always write or say abbreviations and acronyms in full.
- If words are written in full, in most cases the words can be easily understood, even by people new to Tesco.
- Some commonly-used words and phrases that are harder to understand, even when said or written in full, are explained in this latest edition of the Jargonbuster.

**Guidelines for avoiding abbreviations, acronyms and jargon**
Always write abbreviations and acronyms out in full and explain any jargon or hard to understand words.  
There are just two exceptions to this:
- If there isn’t enough space available on a graph, table or diagram to
write words out in full, use abbreviations but provide a key on the
same page.
- Some abbreviated words have become accepted as everyday
language. These include CD, DVD, AM, PM, UK. In these cases, the abbreviation can be used.
