#### Team 5

#### Team Leader

#### Team pad
The touch-screen computer mounted on Dotcom trolleys which lets Personal Shoppers know which products to pick. Each Team pad has a hand held scanner attached, which is used to scan the barcode on each product. Team pads connect to the picking control system via a wireless radio signal, transmitted for the Dotcom area. Each new model of Team pad is distinguished by number, for example Team pad 3.
