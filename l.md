#### Lifestyle break
One of Tesco’s flexible working options open to staff with a minimum of one year’s service. A lifestyle break is between 4-12 weeks. The reason for this may include holidays over 4 weeks, voluntary work, study leave, personal matter or religious pilgrimage. A lifestyle break does not affect employment status.

#### Like for like (LFL)
Data compared to the same time as last year. For example like-for-like sales is the increase in sales compared to same time in the previous year, excluding new store openings.

#### Live the values
This is one of the key themes of the leadership framework. It’s all about your personal approach and behaving with integrity. If you ‘live the values’ you will support and praise more than criticise and share your knowledge to help others develop.
