# The Tesco jargon buster

## L is for…

#### Ladder rack
A set of shelves usually displaying our best offers attached to a promotion end or on the end of an aisle.

#### Late cage
A cage that is arriving late at store.

#### Late picks
See [Depot gaps](d.md#depot-gaps).

#### Leadership framework
The leadership framework was developed by the board of directors to describe what they see our best leaders doing. The Leadership Framework has three key themes, which are:
- Improve the business for customers
- Take People with You
- Live the Values

#### Leadership team
The distribution directors.

#### Lifestyle break
One of Tesco’s flexible working options open to staff with a minimum of one year’s service. A lifestyle break is between 4-12 weeks. The reason for this may include holidays over 4 weeks, voluntary work, study leave, personal matter or religious pilgrimage. A lifestyle break does not affect employment status.

#### Like for like
Data compared to the same time as last year. For example like-for-like sales is the increase in sales compared to same time in the previous year, excluding new store openings.

#### Lines
See [Products](p.md#products).

#### Live the values
This is one of the key themes of the leadership framework. It’s all about your personal approach and behaving with integrity. If you ‘live the values’ you will support and praise more than criticise and share your knowledge to help others develop.

#### Long life
Products with seven days or more until its ‘display until’, ‘use by’ or ‘ best before’ date, whichever is soonest.

#### Lost cage
A cage that is lost in the network and its whereabouts is unknown.

#### Lost sales cage
